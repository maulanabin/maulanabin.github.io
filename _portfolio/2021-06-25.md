# About the Project
This project implements a Java application for managing vehicle registration and tax information.

# Key Features and Objectives
  1. Vehicle and Tax Data Management: Stores and manages vehicle information including registration number (TNKB), owner name, vehicle type, engine capacity, year, and payment month.
  2. Data Storage and Retrieval: Utilizes arrays to store multiple vehicle and tax records.
  3. Data Display Functionality: Provides methods to display all stored vehicle and tax information in a tabular format.
  4. Search and Filter Capabilities: Allows searching for tax records above a specified nominal amount (e.g., above 300,000).
  5. Sorting Functionality: Implements a sorting method to arrange vehicle data based on owner names.
  6. User Interface and Interaction: Presents a menu-driven interface for user interaction. Includes options for displaying data, searching, sorting, and exiting the program.
