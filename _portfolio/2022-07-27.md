title: "Configuring and Managing Local Area Networks (LANs) with Routers"
excerpt: "This project involves configuring two distinct local area networks (LANs) and managing their connectivity through routers. The primary goal is to set up IP addresses and gateways for multiple PCs, configure routers with specific settings, and ensure network connectivity between different network segments. This project is designed to provide hands-on experience with network configuration, routing, and network management."

# About the Project
This project involves configuring two distinct local area networks (LANs) and managing their connectivity through routers. The primary goal is to set up IP addresses and gateways for multiple PCs, configure routers with specific settings, and ensure network connectivity between different network segments. This project is designed to provide hands-on experience with network configuration, routing, and network management.

# Key Features and Objectives
  1. IP Address Configuration: Assign IP addresses and gateways to PCs in two different subnets.
  2. Router Configuration: Set up and configure two routers with specific names, passwords, interfaces, and static routes.
  3. Network Connectivity Testing: Verify connectivity between PCs in different subnets using ping tests.
