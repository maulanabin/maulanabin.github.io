# About the Project
Simple Cashier Program (Fruit Shop) is a project focused on basic programming using the Java programming language to create a functional point-of-sale application. This program enables users to manage inventory, process transactions, and generate sales reports for a fruit shop. It serves as a practical implementation of fundamental programming concepts.

# Key Features and Objectives
  1. My Face: Detects the presence of my face within images.
  2. User Authentication: The program implements a basic login system with a predefined username and password.
  3. Inventory Management: It allows for the entry and display of fruit types and their corresponding prices.
  4. Dynamic Product Addition: Users can add new fruit types and prices to the existing inventory.
  5. Transaction Processing: The system enables multiple fruit purchases in a single transaction, calculating totals for each item and the overall purchase.
  6. Payment Handling: It processes customer payments and calculates change.
  7. Receipt Generation: The program generates a detailed receipt showing individual items, quantities, prices, and totals.
  8. Promotional Features: Implements a day-based reward system, offering gifts for purchases above certain thresholds on specific days.
  9. Repeat Purchase Option: Includes functionality for customers to make additional purchases without restarting the program.
