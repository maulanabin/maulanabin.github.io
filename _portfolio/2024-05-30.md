title: "Comprehensive Non-Functional and Functional Testing of a Mobile-Based Calorie Counter Application"
excerpt: "This project focuses on the comprehensive testing of a mobile-based calorie counter application, which includes both non-functional (load testing) and functional (black box testing) assessments. The non-functional testing was conducted using Apache JMeter to evaluate the application's performance under various loads, while the functional testing was performed using black box testing techniques to ensure the application's features work as intended."

# About the Project
This project focuses on the comprehensive testing of a mobile-based calorie counter application, which includes both non-functional (load testing) and functional (black box testing) assessments. The non-functional testing was conducted using Apache JMeter to evaluate the application's performance under various loads, while the functional testing was performed using black box testing techniques to ensure the application's features work as intended.

# Key Features and Objectives
- Load Testing with Apache JMeter:
  1. Objective: To evaluate the performance and scalability of the mobile-based calorie counter application under different load conditions.
  2. Key Results: The serverless architecture of the application performed well, handling up to 310 users simultaneously using two instances on Google Cloud Platform. This was measured through key performance indicators such as response time, throughput, and error rate.
- Functional Testing with Black Box Testing:
  1. Objective: To ensure that the application’s features meet the specified requirements and function correctly.
  2. Key Results: The black box testing of six key features of the application showed a 100% effectiveness rate, indicating that the application meets all predefined criteria and functions as expected.
