title: "Obesifix: A Mobile-Based Calorie Counter Application with Cloud Integration"
excerpt: "Obesifix is a product-based capstone project developed as part of the Bangkit Academy 2023 program. This innovative mobile application is designed to help users count calories in their food, integrating three key learning paths: Mobile Development, Machine Learning, and Cloud Computing. As a participant in the Cloud Computing learning path, I contributed to the project within the C23-PS344 group.
The primary goal of Obesifix is to provide users with an easy-to-use tool for monitoring their calorie intake, supporting healthier lifestyle choices and potentially addressing obesity-related concerns. By leveraging the power of machine learning and cloud computing, the application offers accurate and efficient calorie estimation based on food images."

# About the Project
Obesifix is a product-based capstone project developed as part of the Bangkit Academy 2023 program. This innovative mobile application is designed to help users count calories in their food, integrating three key learning paths: Mobile Development, Machine Learning, and Cloud Computing. As a participant in the Cloud Computing learning path, I contributed to the project within the C23-PS344 group.
The primary goal of Obesifix is to provide users with an easy-to-use tool for monitoring their calorie intake, supporting healthier lifestyle choices and potentially addressing obesity-related concerns. By leveraging the power of machine learning and cloud computing, the application offers accurate and efficient calorie estimation based on food images.

# Key Features and Objectives
  1. Image-based Calorie Estimation: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze food images and provide accurate calorie counts.
  2. User-friendly Mobile Interface: Offers an intuitive and accessible mobile application for easy user interaction.
  3. Cloud-powered Backend: Implements a robust cloud infrastructure to ensure scalability, reliability, and real-time data processing.
  4. Data Storage and Management: Employs cloud-based database solutions for efficient data handling and storage.
  5. Integration of Multiple Technologies: Seamlessly combines mobile development, machine learning, and cloud computing technologies.
