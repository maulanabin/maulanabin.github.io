# About the Project
This project, developed as part of an advanced web programming course, focuses on predicting whether customers are interested in purchasing new vehicles using machine learning techniques. The analysis employs three distinct classification models: Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, and Logistic Regression. By leveraging these algorithms, the project aims to provide insights into customer behavior and preferences in the automotive market.

# Key Features and Objectives
  1. Multi-Model Approach: Utilizes three popular machine learning models (Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, and Logistic Regression) to compare and evaluate prediction accuracy.
  2. Customer Interest Prediction: Aims to classify customers into two categories: those interested in purchasing new vehicles and those who are not.
  3. Data-Driven Decision Making: Helps automotive businesses make informed decisions by understanding factors influencing customer purchase intentions.
  4. Model Comparison: Analyzes the performance of each model to determine the most effective approach for this specific prediction task.
  5. Feature Analysis: Identifies key features that significantly influence a customer's likelihood of purchasing a new vehicle.
  6. Actionable Insights: Provides valuable information for marketing strategies, inventory management, and sales forecasting in the automotive industry.
