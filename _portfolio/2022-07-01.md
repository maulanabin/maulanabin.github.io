# About the Project
In the final project for the Advanced Web Programming course, we developed a School Inventory Management System aimed at simplifying the management of inventory data for school staff. This web application facilitates the tracking of inventory items and the recording of transactions for items being checked in and out. The system is built using PHP with the Laravel framework and utilizes MySQL for database management.

# Key Features and Objectives
  1. Inventory Management: Efficiently manage data for inventory items, including adding, updating, and deleting records.
  2. Category Management: Organize inventory items into various categories for easier navigation and management.
  3. Supplier Management: Maintain records of suppliers, including their contact information and the items they supply.
  4. User Management: Manage user accounts with different roles and permissions to ensure secure access to the system.
  5. Transaction Reporting: Generate and print detailed reports of inventory transactions, including items checked in and out, to maintain accurate records and facilitate audits.
