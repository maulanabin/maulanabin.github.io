excerpt: "This project is the outcome of my internship as a Full Stack Web Developer at PSDKU Politeknik Negeri Malang Lumajang Campus. The primary goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive web-based campus information system to introduce PSDKU Polinema Lumajang Campus to the wider community.
The system is built using modern technologies, with Java Spring Boot powering the back-end and React JS driving the front-end. This combination enables rapid, efficient, and maintainable web application development. The project not only demonstrates technical proficiency in full-stack web development but also showcases an understanding of the needs of educational institutions in the digital age."
