# About the Project
This project focuses on developing a recommendation system for selecting dining places, including cafes, restaurants, and eateries, in Bandung City. The system leverages the Sugeno Fuzzy Logic method to evaluate and recommend the best dining options based on food quality and service ratings. By processing data from various dining establishments, the system aims to assist users in making informed decisions about where to dine, considering the increasing number of dining options and the importance of food and service quality.
